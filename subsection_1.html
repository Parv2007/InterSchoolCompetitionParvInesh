						<h3 class = "wow animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInLeft">What is Energy Conservation?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Energy conservation is the effort made to reduce the consumption of energy by using less of an energy service.</li>
							<li>This can be achieved either by using energy more efficiently or by reducing the amount of service used.</li>
							<li>Energy conservation is a part of the concept of Eco-sufficiency.</li>
							<li>Energy conservation reduces the need for energy services and can result in increased environmental quality, national security, personal financial security and higher savings.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class = "wow animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInRight">
						<h3>What is meant by conservation of energy?</h3>
						<p>
							Energy Conservation is refered to as conserving the consumption of energy, either by introducing effective methods of using energy or by inventing new methods of converting energy into a usable form. Or even both.

						<p style = "font-size: 60px;">Solar Power</p>
						<p>
							As the term suggests, solar refers to the sun. And thus, Solar Power refrs to the Sun's power. But how exactly are we supposed to use the Sun's power? Confusing, isn't it? The answer is though, simple. The photovoltaic effect is the principle behind it. In it, the sun's rays are converted into a seried of electrons with the help of photovoltaic cells and are instigated and agitated to form AC current. This AC current can then be used to power our homes, and even large factories. Presently, many companies have destined their goals to make large solar parks in India, for example, Adani Green which has already accomplished the task of making the largest solar park in India which powers almost the whole state of Tamil Nadu. It has even larger plans for the future.

						<p style = "font-size: 60px;">Hydro Power</p>
						<p>
							Originated from the greek word hudor, the word "hydro" refers to water and thus, hydro power means the energy generated from water. This is going to be a piece of cake as I will further explain it. For the generation of hydroelectricity, hydro electric dams are needed. In these dams, the water is allowed to flow down at a high pace from a high structure, into a water body. On falling, the water moves the turbine at the bottom by its pressure. The turbine moves to generate electricty that is transferred to the generator and ultimately, to the transformer which converts the elctricity intto a usable form. The water is then again brought up to the high-leveled structure This can be used for powering large regions without any further human intervention. Everything is automated after it's built. This method of electricity generation is not introduced much in India but I am sure, that soon, it will be.

						<img src = "Hydrogen.gif" style = "float: left; padding-right: 20px;" width = "400px" height = "250px" class = "wow animate__animated animate__rollIn">   
						<div class = "wow animate__animated animate__rubberBand">
						<p style = "font-size: 60px;">Other mediums</p>
						<p>Scientists are devising out many more ways to convince electricity generation. These include using hydrogen and oxygen together in feul cells to generate elctricity and many others. Let me explain you the principle behind the feul cells now. In a feul cell, the chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen dash in. They bond with each other and release the electrons on the electrode. The electrons are then allowed to flow together, which is electricity. Cool, isn't it?</p></div>
